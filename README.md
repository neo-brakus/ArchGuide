## 📘 About

This guide was created after a real manual Arch installation experience. It's designed for users who find the [official Arch Linux installation guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Installation_guide) too minimal or intimidating at first.

**What makes this guide different?**

- ✅ Every command I personally used is included
- ✅ Clear explanations and reasoning
- ✅ Focus on understanding, not just copying

> ⚠️ This guide is not the *ultimate* or *only* way to install Arch, but it's a solid, beginner-oriented walkthrough based on a real install.
